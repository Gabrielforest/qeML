Description: The letters 'qe' in the package title stand for "quick and
   easy," alluding to the convenience goal of the package. We bring
   together a variety of machine learning (ML) tools from standard R
   packages, providing wrappers with a simple, convenient, 
   and uniform interface.  A number of advanced functions are
   also included.  "Easy for learners, powerful for advanced users."
